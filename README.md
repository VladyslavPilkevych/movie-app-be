<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>My project is a movie application developed using modern web technologies and architectural approaches. In this application, you can browse movie information, search films, and manage your favorites list.</p>

<ul>
    <h3>Here are the key technologies used in the project:</h3>
    <li><strong>Java Spring Boot:</strong> Serves as the backbone of the backend, providing a comprehensive framework for building a RESTful API. Spring Boot simplifies the development process with its embedded server and extensive ecosystem of tools and libraries.</li>
    <li><strong>Spring Security (in progress):</strong> Ensures the application is secure by implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms, protecting user data and managing access control.</li>
    <li><strong>Spring Data JPA:</strong> Facilitates interaction with the SQLite database through a high-level object-oriented abstraction. It simplifies CRUD operations and provides a powerful query mechanism.</li>
    <li><strong>SQLite:</strong> Used as the relational database to store and manage movie data. SQLite is lightweight and easily integrable with Spring Boot, ensuring fast data access and reliability.</li>
    <li><strong>Exception Handling (in progress):</strong> Exposes endpoints for the frontend to interact with, enabling functionalities such as fetching movie details, searching for movies, and managing user favorites.</li>
    <li><strong>RESTful API:</strong> Implements global exception handling to manage errors gracefully, providing meaningful error messages and ensuring the stability of the application.</li>
    <li><strong>Testing (in progress):</strong> Incorporates unit and integration tests using JUnit and Mockito to ensure the reliability and correctness of the backend components.</li>
</ul>
